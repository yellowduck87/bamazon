Working on the backend is at the same time dull and also strangely satisfying. I can already see how the tools I learned while creating this suite of apps can apply to some real-world applications, especially in retail. It is run with node.js and MySql.

### There are three apps in this project:
1. Bamazon.js--a customer portal to purchase items listed in the database

2. Bamazon_manager.js--an app to allow for inventory additions and maintinence. 

3. Bamazon_supervisor.js--an app to read total sales by department. The sales trhough the customer portal automatically update the database that is displayed in this app. 

### Some of the issues I came across while coding this project include:
* drilling down to the correct portion of the correct table
* arithmatic within connection.queries
* learning the syntax for each MySql command
* finding a format that was easy to read and easy to adjust

As I practie more and become more saturated in coding, I begin to see that my way of thinking is much more computer-like. In this project in particular, I was very sucessful and efficient while debugging. 

These apps were coded by Megan W Evans
